# Policy Enforcement 

Eve heard about policy engines and the possibility to enforce standards and wants to implement this in her environment. She heard that it's possible to enforce some securityContext settings and the sources of images and therefore she would like to let this run in her environment.

Set up Kyverno or OPA in your Environment and install your Helm Chart on it. Write some policies.

## Deliverables
* One Pager about Policy Engines and some concepts
* Terraform Configuration for a Kubernetes Cluster with Exoscale
* A short demo of your setup (including some documentation) today

Everything should be delivered in this Repository (PR)
