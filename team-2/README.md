# Flux 

Alice heard about GitOps and wants to implement this in her environment. She also was very impressed about the Application you wrote in the last task and therefore she would like to let this run in her environment.

Set up the Flux Environment and install your Helm Chart with it.

## Deliverables
* One Pager about GitOps, Flux and some concepts
* Terraform Configuration for a Kubernetes Cluster with Exoscale
* A short demo of your setup (including some documentation) today

Everything should be delivered in this Repository (PR)
