# ArgoCD

Bob heard about GitOps and wants to implement this in his environment. He also was very impressed by the Application you wrote in the last task and therefore he would like to let this run in his environment.

Set up the Argo Environment and install your Helm Chart with it.

## Deliverables
* One Pager about GitOps, ArgoCD and some concepts
* Terraform Configuration for a Kubernetes Cluster with Exoscale
* A short demo of your setup (including some documentation) today

Everything should be delivered in this Repository (PR)
