# Metrics 

Olivia found out that it's a good idea to gather metrics from the Kubernetes Environment and wants to implement Prometheus and Grafana in her environment. She also heard that it's possible to scrape metrics from application pods and wants to try this out

Set up Prometheus and Grafana in your Environment and monitor some demo application with it

## Deliverables
* One Pager about Cloud Native Monitoring and some concepts
* Terraform Configuration for a Kubernetes Cluster with Exoscale
* A short demo of your setup (including some documentation) today

Everything should be delivered in this Repository (PR)
